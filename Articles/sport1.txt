Football is one of the most popularly played games around the world. It is the most 
interesting and engaging as well as one of the oldest games in the world. This game 
requires a lot of enthusiasm and excitement, which is seen in the tournaments and world 
cups by both the players and the spectators. It is a game of eleven players in a team where 
two teams play against each other. The game is named football because it is played by our 
feet to pass the ball, and the use of hands is considered a foul.
